=head1 NAME

Acme::MetaSyntactic::summerwine - The 'Last of the Summer Wine' theme

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Characters in I<Last of the Summer Wine>, the longest-running sitcom in the
world.  Only the 'main' name by which each character is addressed is used
(nickname, Christian name, or surname depending on the character) so that they
make better identifiers.

=head1 CONTRIBUTOR

Smylers, who paid £42 for the privilege at the YAPC Europe 2006 auction
in Birmingham.

This theme was chosen because I<Last of the Summer Wine> is set in Smylers's
home town of Holmfirth (in West Yorkshire in the UK), the main character names
are quite fun to use as identifiers, and it was an unlikely theme to be
included otherwise.  Having minor characters called 'Pearl' and 'Smiler' is a
bonus.

Introduced in Acme-MetaSyntactic version 0.99, published on November 6, 2006.

Received its own version number for Acme-MetaSyntactic-Themes version 1.000,
published on May 7, 2012.

Updated with an C<=encoding> pod command in version 1.001,
published on May 14,2012
